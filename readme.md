# Taffy

Also in: [Indonesian](readme.id.md)

Taffy is a web novel/music album project intiaied by HDX13 that features the 
story of a boy with musical talent, glowing hand, and self-control issues. 
For the story, it is currently written in two languages: English and Indonesia. 

Currently, this story is hosted in two sites: [GitHub] and [Penflip]. 

[GitHub]: https://github.com/hdx13-beatcode/taffy
[Penflip]: https://penflip.com/HDX13_BeatCode/Taffy

* GitHub will be the alpha mirror and will receive the latest updates as soon as
  it is pushed, so it may be rough on the edges. Those "edges" may involve merge
  conflicts, grammar mistakes, drafts, and other garbage.
* Penflip is the beta mirror and will be updated once the mess has been cleaned 
  on the alpha mirror. I will update this repo when some parts of the chapter 
  is ready to be reviewed to the limited public.
* Stable mirror is where the chapers ready for public reads. When all the
  issues have been resolved, I will update this part. I might be planning to use
  Wattpad or a static site generator for this mirror.

## Synopsis

TBD

## Reading Guide

We will be using these files for examples: 
`00.md`, `00.id.md`, `01.md`, `11.md`, and `12.id.md`.

* The numbering system uses hexadecimal format. This means number 10 is 
  represented as `A`, 11 as `B`, 12 as `C`, until 15 as `F`. 0 is `0` here 
  and will represent the prologue for the respective story/act.
* The first digit represents the act number. This means `00.md`, 
  `00.id.md`, and `01.md` is in the prologue act. `11.md` and 
  `12.id.md` belongs to the first act.
* The second digit represents the chapter number. Chapter 0 is a prologue 
  chapter for the act. Sometimes, an act doesn't have a prologue (`*0.md`).
  It doesn't matter much.
* The additional two-letter code is the language for the file. `*.id.md` means
  it's in Indonesian. No additional codes means the file is written in English.
* The story is written in Markdown, an easy writing syntax that is easy to read
  both as a text file or rendered in the web browser.
