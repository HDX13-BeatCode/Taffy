# Taffy

Taffy is a boy that endured so many problems in his life. He has been bullied basically throughout his life. To make it worse, he has a glowing hand that stores deep power within. He never wanted to use his hand to hurt people in any way. Ever.

He eventually hide himself from the society by living in the middle of the forest, alone. Inside an abandoned house, he makes melodic drops that the world has never heard of. Until now.
