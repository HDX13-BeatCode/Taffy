It's 5 AM, and my phone is ringing. Smooth, yet engaging enough to activate by brains. Slowly build up the momentum on my body to wake up. With both of my hands on the bed, I rise to a position where I can turn my head around and see my little device blinking.

I step my foot onto the cold, freezing floor. .....

After I completed my morning ritual (it is classified), there are two options. First, go back to bed and fall asleep for hours. Second, fire up my PC and start making more beats.

One day, I went out for a little foraging. Then, there's this buzzing noise coming from above.
